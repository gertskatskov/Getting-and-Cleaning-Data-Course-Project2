SUBJECT NUMBERS
Subjects come from files "subject_test.txt" from both "train" and "test" folders.
We bind the to dataset "Subject.Data"

MEASUREMENTS
Recorded activity is in files "X_train.txt" and "X_test.txt". We bind them to dataset "Features.Data"

ACTIVITY TYPE
Activities are described as numbers from 1 to 6 and are found in "Y_train.txt" and "Y_test.txt". We bind them to dataset  "Activity.Data"

Subject numbers ("Subject.Data"") and activity type ("Activity.Data") are merged to
become first 2 rows of final dataset to show the subject number and type of activity under variables "Subject" and "Activity"

VARIABLE NAMES are imported from "features.txt"

RESULT
All above mentioned data are merged to dataset "combined"

MEAN AND STANDART DEVIATION
New dataset "Dataset" is created with only mean and standart deviation for each measurement.
